Summary
---

The results would show that there is definitely positivity bias based on those that get paid for reviews and those that do not. In order to get a better representation for reviews would be to run other product reviews through to see the number of Vine program and non-Vine program reviews and their percentages as well. This dataset with only 94 reviews on the Vine program does not really help to show how biased it is or is not.
